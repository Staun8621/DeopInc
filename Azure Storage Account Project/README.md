How to evaluate the use of Azure storage for storing files residing currently in on-premises data stores.
While majority of these files are not accessed frequently, there are some exceptions.
We would like to minimize cost of storage by placing less frequently accessed files in lower-priced storage tiers.
We also plan to explore different protection mechanisms that Azure Storage offers,
including network access, authentication, authorization, and replication.
Finally, we want to determine to what extent Azure Files service might be suitable for hosting our on-premises file shares.
